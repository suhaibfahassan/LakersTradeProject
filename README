# Lakers Player Trade Project

## This repo will consist of **data cleansing**, **data transformation**, and **gathering insights** through **Microsoft SQL Server**.
The goal of this project is to create a strong integral database of NBA players in the 2023-24 season. This database includes data in regards to their personal performance, salaries YOY, and their teams overall performance. The purpose of this project
is to find a solid roster of players that are trade eligible/nearing free agency to be picked up by my favourite team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Using this data to be laoded into Tableau, I will create a dashboard for the Lakers organization to give them
a better view of the players available for them to target along with their performances and salaries. I will also include all 30 teams in the NBA and their overall performances throughout the season to compare the Lakers strengths and weaknesses. This will help
minimize the list of ideal players that the Lakers should target.
